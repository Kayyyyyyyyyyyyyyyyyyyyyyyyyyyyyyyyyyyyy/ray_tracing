# Unity GPU Ray Tracing

Follows three eyed games tutorial blog. 

 
## About

This program replaces unity's rendering with a ray tracing example with a few spheres with different specular and albedo values.
It also lets you change the number of reflections before a ray stops, so you can limit how many reflection loops there are along with some basic camera controls to let you zoom in and out with q and e.
